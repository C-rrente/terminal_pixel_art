Step 1. Fix the infinite loop that takes place if you put two points next to
each other in the quadtree

Step 2. Make a map editor using the colors and read libraries. The user should
hit the keys 1-8 to pick different colors, and then you click on the screen
and color the pixel at that location that color. Hold each click into the
quadtree. A new click will overwrite an old click.

Step 3. Write it to disk. Format:
x,y,color (1-8)
Don't write any uncolored pixels to disk, just the places they clicked. 

Example:
10,20,4
11,3,8
40,20,2
Etc.

Come up with nice looking 8-bit colors for the following options:
0) The void (outside of the map, and is every tile by default)
1) Roads
2) Grass
3) Mountains
4) Deserts
5) Rivers
6) Arctic
7) Swamp
8) Walls
